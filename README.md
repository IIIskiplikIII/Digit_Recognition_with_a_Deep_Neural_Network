# Digit-Recognition-with-a-Deep-Neural-Network (IN EDIT MODE)
This project is based on the Digit Recognizer competition on Kaggle, found here: https://www.kaggle.com/c/digit-recognizer/data.
To sum it up in a nutshell, it is about predicting the correct handwritten digit based on its image pixels. The dataset is the famous MNIST-dataset by Yann LeCun at al. (http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/).

There are several ways to solve this "problem" (for example with a K-Nearest-Neighbor algorithm, found in my repository here: https://github.com/IIIskiplikIII/another-MNIST-try). 
<b>This time instead I chose the Deep Neural Network approach.<b>

## Installing
You need Jupyter Notebook to start and execute this notebook. A good way to install it is with Anaconda. 
There are as well other ways to use it, for example by uploading it in a Google Colab. 
For that, you need to download/upload the data folder into your Google Colab.

### Requirements / Environemnt
There is an environment.yml (conda) file to create your conda environment with all the necessary dependencies. The following dependencies are used:
  - numpy
  - pandas
  - scikit-learn
  - matplotlib
  - tensorflow=2.3.0
